# Code for generating plots in "Complementary task representations in hippocampus and prefrontal cortex for generalizing the structure of problems.(2022) Nature Neuroscience" 

> This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks and .py code for replicating figures in our paper. Behavioural and neural data needs to be downloaded from [here](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.19773334) 

## Installation

## Summary

After downloading the data, cloning the github repository and installing a few basic python packages in the requirements.txt file (above) you should be able to easily run all of the code in Jupyter Notebook

**behaviour.ipynb** will plot all the figures that relate to behavioural results in our paper (both in main and extended Data)

**cells - main figures.ipynb** will plot all the **main figures** that relate to neural results in our paper 

**cells - extended data.ipynb** will plot all the **extended data figures** that relate to neural results in our paper
