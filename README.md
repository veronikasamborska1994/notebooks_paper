> This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks and .py code for replicating the figure in our paper. Behavioural and neural data needs to be downloaded from [here](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.19773334) 

## Installation

## Summary

After downloading the data, cloning the repository and installing a few basic python packages in the requirements.txt file (above) you should be able to easily run all of the code in Jupyter Notebook. 

behaviour.ipynb allows one to plot all the figures that relate to behavioural results in our paper (both in Main and Extended Data)

cells - main figures.ipynb allows one to plot all the **main figures** that relate to neural results in our paper 

cells - extended data.ipynb allows one to plot all the **extended data figures** that relate to neural results in our paper
