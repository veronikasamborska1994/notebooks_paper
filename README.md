## Summary

After downloading the data, cloning the github repository and installing a few basic python packages in the requirements.txt file (above) you should be able to easily run all of the code in Jupyter Notebook. 

behaviour.ipynb will plot all the figures that relate to behavioural results in our paper (both in main and extended Data)

cells - main figures.ipynb will plot all the **main figures** that relate to neural results in our paper 

cells - extended data.ipynb will plot plot all the **extended data figures** that relate to neural results in our paper
